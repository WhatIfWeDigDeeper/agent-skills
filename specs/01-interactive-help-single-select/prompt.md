I want to change the help interactive flow for js-deps and uv-deps to change everything to single select with a recommendation preselected.

Workflow
(*) Update dependencies..(recommended) - pre-selected
* Security fixes only

--dependencies workflow
* Patch
(*) Patch + Minor (Recommended)
* Patch + Minor + Major


-- final question
Skip x.y.0 versions to wait for bug patch


-- security flow
* Critical
(*) Critical + High (Recommended)
* Critical + High + Moderate
* All: Critical + High + Moderate + Low

Thoughts?
